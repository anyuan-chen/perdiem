# Perdiem

Budget tracker app focused on delivering a simple visualization-heavy experience to users newer to managing their own expenses and the financial space.

## Installation

First, clone the respository. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anyuan-chen/perdiem.git
```
Next, enter the respository folder and install required packages. Make sure you have a version of Node.js 12+.
```bash
cd perdiem
npm i
```
After all dependencies have finished installing, start the development server. 
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
