## Installation

Next, enter the respository folder and install required packages. Make sure you have a version of Node.js 12+.

npm i
```
After all dependencies have finished installing, start the development server. 
```bash

```

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). Internal API calls are used by the frontend, but the application can be used as a backend for other frontends that may want to make use of the API as well.
